## 911_Call_Emergency_Predictor
A machine learning model using Support Vector Machine, Bagging, Random Forest which predicts what type of 911 emergency call 

Technology used: Matplotlab, Sci-kit Learn, Pandas, Google Maps

The program was impleneted by doing some data mining operations on a dataset of type of emergency calls in Pittburgh, the 3 classified values would be EMT, Police, Fire. 

The model used three main machine learning algorithms such as RandomForest Tree, Support Vector Machine, Bagging.
